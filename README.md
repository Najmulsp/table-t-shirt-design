# React Project: Custom Table and T-Shirt Customizer

This project consists of two main features:
1. A custom table that displays data with search and pagination functionality.
2. A T-shirt customizer where users can upload a logo, drag it, and position it anywhere on the T-shirt, and then download it.

## Features

### 1. Custom Table
- Displays data fetched from an API: `https://api.razzakfashion.com`.
- Supports search functionality using a search bar.
- Implements pagination to navigate through data in chunks (e.g., 5 items per page).
- Fully developed without using any external libraries for the table.

### 2. T-Shirt Customizer
- Allows users to upload a predefined T-shirt image.
- Users can upload a logo and position it anywhere on the T-shirt using drag-and-drop.
- Includes a resizing feature for the logo while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- Combines the T-shirt and logo into a final image that the user can download.
